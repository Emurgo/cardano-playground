## Advanced Configuration: Sanchonet Testnet

Users wanting to test a cardano-node pre-release version on the sanchonet
environment may obtain compatible configuration files below.

NOTE: When respun on 2024-04-12 the chain will be restored from slot 20044800.
Any Sanchonet chain participants, stakepools, integrators, etc, will need to
clear their chain state to re-sync from that point forward.
